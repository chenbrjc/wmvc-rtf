# WMVC (Web MVC) - Real Time Reactive Fulfillment

The WMVC (web-based MVC) architectural paradigms can be grouped into three categories, as illustrated previously in Polymorphism of MVC-esque Web Architecture: Classification.  Two of them, Dual WMVC (dWMVC) and Peer-to-Peer WMVC (pWMVC), can be leveraged to build dynamic, real time, and reactive web application components.  Each of the packages in this repository consists of a demonstration of the design and implementation of one of these two reactive architectural schemes with variable technological stacks. 


dwmvc-angular-java-sql:  A dWMVC realization based on AngularJS, Java/JavaEE, and PostgreSQL.


dwmvc-angular-node-nosql: A dWMVC realization based on AngularJS, NodeJS, and RethinkDB.


pwmvc-pusher-datachannel: A pWMVC realization based on AngularJS, PusherJS, and DataChannelJS.


Detailed illustration and discussion of these design and implementation are to be introduced.
