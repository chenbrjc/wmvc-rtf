#WMVC (Web MVC) - Real Time Reactive Fulfillment
The WMVC (web-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>) architectural paradigms can be grouped into three categories, as illustrated previously in <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/mvc-web-architecture-polymorphism">Polymorphism of MVC-esque Web Architecture: Classification</a>.  Two of them, Dual WMVC (dWMVC) and Peer-to-Peer WMVC (pWMVC), can be leveraged to build dynamic, real time, and reactive web application components.  Each of the packages in this repository consists of a demonstration of the design and implementation of one of these two reactive architectural schemes with variable technological stacks. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>dwmvc-angular-java-sql:</b>  A dWMVC realization based on <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, Java/JavaEE, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>dwmvc-angular-node-nosql:</b> A dWMVC realization based on <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>, and <a href="https://www.rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a>.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>pwmvc-pusher-datachannel:</b> A pWMVC realization based on <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js">PusherJS</a>, and <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/DataChannel/">DataChannelJS</a>.


Detailed illustration and discussion of these design and implementation are to be introduced.
